// Exercise 1.4
// ------------
// Creating a Cat class - Part 4

// A) So far so good.
//    In real life, we naturally get more tired/hungry/lonely as time passes.
//    Let's add a new method, `wait`. It accepts a number of minutes as the
//    parameter. The cat's tiredness, hunger, and loneliness should increase
//    as the amount of time increases. They should also become less happy.
//
//    It's up to you to decide how quickly these values should change.

// B) Make Boots wait 20 minutes and call then console.log(boots);
// (the wait function accepts a number that will modify all the cat's properties)
// DO NOT make a setTimeout that runs after 20 minutes have passed
